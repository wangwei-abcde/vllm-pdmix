This module provides :class:`SharedModelMultiprocExecutor` and

on the **edge side** of the shared-model edge-cloud topology (where
multiple DP ranks on the edge share a single ``nn.Module`` in NPU

class SharedModelWorkerProc:
    """The single ``WorkerProc`` that hosts all DP-rank edge virtual
    workers.

    It implements the same protocol as the upstream
    :class:`vllm.v1.executor.multiproc_executor.WorkerProc` (i.e. is
    duck-type compatible) but **does not** inherit from it. The
    upstream class is left untouched. All upstream machinery is
    reused except for the message queues and the busy loop, which
    have to poll N MQs (one per edge executor) instead of blocking
    on a single MQ.

    MQ construction follows the upstream pattern exactly (per
    dp_rank ``k``):

    * ``self.rpc_broadcast_mqs[k]`` is the **edge-broadcast reader**
      — the return value of
      ``get_inner_dp_world_group_k(k).create_mq_broadcaster(
          external_writer_handle=shared_broadcast_handles[k],
          blocking=False)``.
      The edge executor_k is the external writer (its handle is
      passed via ``external_writer_handle``).

    * ``self.response_mqs[k]`` and
      ``self.peer_response_handles[k]`` come from
      ``get_inner_dp_world_group_k(k).create_single_reader_mq_broadcasters(
          reader_rank_in_group=0, vllm_config=vllm_config)`` —
      the return is a ``(self_response_mq, [peer_handles...])``
      tuple, exactly like the upstream ``WorkerProc``. The first
      element is the **own response writer MQ**
      (``MessageQueue(n_reader=1, n_local_reader=1)`` on this
      process) whose reader is the matching edge executor. The
      second element is the list of c cloud workers' writer
      handles, which the executor attaches as readers (mirroring
      the upstream pattern).

        The standard upstream loop blocks on a single
        ``self.rpc_broadcast_mq.dequeue(indefinite=True)``; the
        shared model design needs a multi-MQ round-robin because
        :class:`MessageQueue` has no multi-MQ select primitive.

        Cross-dp_rank pacing
        --------------------
        The shared model runner assumes the per-dp_rank
        ``execute_model`` / ``execute_dummy_batch`` calls are
        driven in lockstep — i.e. all dp_ranks finish the current
        scheduler step before any of them starts the next. To
        enforce that invariant on the dispatch side, the busy
        loop runs a "round barrier" over :attr:`SYNC_METHODS`:

        * On every dispatch whose method is in
          :attr:`SYNC_METHODS`, the dispatching dp_rank is
          marked *paused* and the busy loop will not dequeue
          from its MQ for the rest of the current round.
        * At the end of each pass over the MQs, if every
          dp_rank is paused the round is complete and all
          dp_ranks are unpaused — a new round begins.
        * If only a subset of dp_ranks are paused, the round
          is still in progress; the busy loop simply continues
          to the next pass. The remaining unpaused dp_ranks
          will get their chance to dispatch (and pause) in
          subsequent passes; once every dp_rank is paused,
          the round resets.
        * The pause is *global* per dp_rank — non-SYNC methods
          (e.g. ``add_lora``) queued behind a SYNC method on
          the same MQ will not be dequeued while the dp_rank
          is paused. They are picked up on the next round.

        Batch postprocess of ``execute_model`` results
        ----------------------------------------------
        ``SharedModelEdgeWorker.execute_model`` does the head
        forward + PP send synchronously and returns the tail
        recv + tail forward wrapped in a
        :class:`DeferredExecutePostprocess` marker — an
        :class:`AsyncModelRunnerOutput` subclass that is also
        callable. ``_dispatch`` detects the marker via
        ``isinstance(output, AsyncModelRunnerOutput)`` and
        stores it in ``self._pending_deferred``; when the
        round barrier is reached at the end of the pass, the
        busy loop calls each marker first (the call invokes
        ``__call__``, which runs the deferred tail processing
        and returns the raw postprocess result — no extra
        type check), then routes the result to the matching
        response MQ via ``handle_output`` →
        ``enqueue_output``. The downstream
        ``enqueue_output`` does its own
        ``isinstance(output, AsyncModelRunnerOutput)`` /
        ``get_output()`` unwrap, in case the postprocess
        itself returned an async output. The
        ``DeferredExecutePostprocess.get_output`` method (an
        alternative entry point that does one more type
        check) is reserved for direct callers that bypass
        ``enqueue_output``.
